Kickstarter
===========

A kickstarter-style alumni fund for DA-IICT student clubs and projects


Idea
====

Connect student-clubs with alumnis. Student-clubs in the college are supported by limited funding or sometimes are even bootstrapped. Much good work is lost for the lack of economic support. When the same students step in the shoes of alumnis, they continue to remain stakeholdersin the club activities. A programmer would love to see the programming-culture foster, a college magazine writer would want to see the magazine distributed more widely, a movie enthusiast would like to see the movie culture stays healthy. With Kickstarter, the alumnis can be a direct part of the student activities.


## Why not use Kickstarter or using other crowd-funding platform?

* On any other platform, the noise (non-community projects and social interactions related to non-community members) present will dampen the interactions.
* Serving focused communities also allows for richer interactions missing in a for-all platform. For instance, transparency reports for the fund usage can be enforced.
